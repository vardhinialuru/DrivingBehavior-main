# Driving Behaviour

This repository contains a dataset of driving behavior collected from various drivers in different environments. The dataset includes information on acceleration and gyroscopic behavior measured in three axes, as well as a timestamp and a class label.

The dataset is available in CSV format and includes the following columns:

#timestamp: Time of measurement in milliseconds since the start of the trip
AccX: Vehicle acceleration in the X-axis in meters per second squared (m/s^2)
AccY: Vehicle acceleration in the Y-axis in meters per second squared (m/s^2)
AccZ: Vehicle acceleration in the Z-axis in meters per second squared (m/s^2)
GyroX: Gyroscope measurement in the X-axis in radians per second (rad/s)
GyroY: Gyroscope measurement in the Y-axis in radians per second (rad/s)
GyroZ: Gyroscope measurement in the Z-axis in radians per second (rad/s)
Class: Class label indicating the type of driving behavior, such as "normal", "aggressive", or "slow".
#Data Source
The dataset was collected using a combination of sensors and software installed in the vehicles of various drivers. The data was then processed and cleaned to remove any invalid or duplicate entries.

#Data Usage
This dataset can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Developing machine learning models to classify driving behavior
Analyzing driving patterns to identify areas for improvement in driver safety and performance
Building applications that provide real-time feedback to drivers based on their behavior
